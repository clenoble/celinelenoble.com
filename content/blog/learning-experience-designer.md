The transition from teaching to UX might seem unexpected, but they have in fact many things in common. In fact, you could think of a teacher as a Learning Experience Designer.

### Both are human centered

Teachers and designers both work with human and to improve human experience; human meaning students and learners for the former, or users for the later. 

Designers have to work towards business goals, and it's not always easy to conciliate good UX and some business tricks. Teachers' objectives are layed out in the curriculum. They also have to reconcile curriculum demands and students' desires, which are not always aligned.

### Cognitive science and psychology

To achieve this, in both cases, you have to know your audience well. As a teacher, it means knowing about your pupils both in a theoretical way and a personal one. 

Theory means you know and use development phases and cognitive abilities at different stages, so a teacher is already familiar with cognitive load, working memory, attention span and is used to work within these constraints. Theory means also psychology, especially behavioral psychology: how to explain existing behaviors, how to motivate students and encourage productive attitudes. Not only do teachers know about the theories, they get to apply and test them every day.

Cognitive science and psychology are two essential components in crafting a good user experience. Children and adults do differ on these two aspects, but not so much as we might think.

### Do some research

The obvious difference is that a teacher get to know their students personally too, which no doubt makes it easier to design tailored made activities and lessons. 

This the reason why I believe UX research is so important in design. Sure you can't possibly know all your customers as well as teachers know their students, but getting to know some of them through field observation, interviews, survey or tests can go a long way.

Teachers also do some user research in their own way: tests (especially diagnostic ones) are used to inform their teaching.

### Holistic thinking

Teachers are used to think of experience as a whole: they design both the learning supports (from paper to websites, including presentations and interactive whiteboard exercises), the activities around them and what's to be done before or after class. 

UX designers don't just craft a usable interface, but what's more and more known as customer experience, encompassing not only the interactions within the website or application, but all the online and offline activities (from tweets and facebook posted by friends, online reviews to customer service).

### Emotional design

Teachers are used to harness the power of emotions to improve learning. Strong, positive emotions are associated with better memorization. Provoking and dealing with emotions is undoubtedly easier face-to-face than when the experience is mediated through an interface. 

### Time constraints

Teachers' time constraints are enormous: they have to produce more or less 20 hours of class activities and supports every week. It's hard, especially when you start and you don't have the past year to rely on. It's so hard that some teachers give up and re-use lessons taken somewhere else "as is". It's also very frustrating when you're kind of a perfectionnist, because you materially don't have the time to get this to the perfection standards you'd like it to be.

Designers tend to be perfectionnist too: hence the phrase pixel-perfect design. They also work with a deadline, and within a team on which they often depend for the live version of their design. Developers obsess about details too, but not the same: they want to weed out every bug and security vulnerability. 

### Iterate and improve based on feedback. 

Teachers don't get to test their ideas prior to release. They always live-test their design in front of very demanding users. Not much room for errors! But they also get to improve on their design with each class and each year, thanks to often straightforward feedbacks from their students. Some might not be always constructive, but it's part of the teacher's job to figure out what went wrong in this case. 

Designers have the opportunity to do testing and observe their users interacting with their design before the actual release. That's why prototyping and testing can be helpful. Then we can improve our product early and not wait until the go live.
