I always felt a strong familiarity between pedagogy and UX. I already draw parallels between the professions of teacher and designer in this article. I would like to go further and argue that UX and pedagogy share the same fundamental principles.

I define pedagogy as trigerring and cultivating the desire to learn, providing the right framework, tools and resources for students to accomplish their (learning) goals.

Substitute "use a product or service" to "learn", "users" instead of "students" and it works perfectly. UX as a discipline aims to trigger and cultivate the desire to use a product or service by providing the right framework, tools and resources so users can accomplish their goals. Both teachers and UX specialists want their audience to enjoy themselves while providing them with something they value. Both professions design medias and interactions tailored to human needs. 

The parallel goes deeper: to provide the best UX possible, you need to understand users' goals, motivations, needs, desires, constraints and environment. These are all essentials components to take into account when designing a learning experience (aka lesson plan). Designers have it easier here, as they directly fill the needs or match the desires of users. Teachers have to find workarounds most of the time to attach the prescribed curriculum content to a genuine motivation. 

There lies one of the major differences between teacher and designers. There are others of course: mostly analog experiences vs mostly digital experiences (though there are online classes as well as designed customer experience in brick and mortar shops); time and scale which is certainly the biggest difference (teachers must work quickly for a small audience, designers work on larger timeframes for a much larger audience); teamwork (or lack of thereof for some teachers unfortunately).

In my first article, I described teachers as learning experience designers. Why this aspect of their job is so rarely acknowledged? I think time makes the greatest difference here. Teachers have to design about 20 hours of lesson plans every week. There's no way to do that if you think of it as a design job. So taking shortcuts is unavoidable, to the detriment of both students and teachers.

There laid my greatest frustration when I was a teacher: the cheer impossibility of designing the best learning experience for 4 to 5 different classes / 20 hours every week. As the research and design aspects of the teacher work was the most interesting part for me, it was a logical step to transition to a design field. User Experience weaves together my interest into design and my altruistic streak.
