Below is a talk I gave during the [ML Fribourg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Fri-ML/) on November 27th 2019.

I have a deep interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning for a few years now and I felt the need to get more hands-on experience. I joined the ML Fribourg meetup in October. Even though they are on the technical side of ML, they welcomed my participation as a UX specialist. I wanted to open the discussion on the potential for discrimination in ML which, quite obviously, can have a huge impact on user experience.

The talk led to a fruitful discussion (not recorded) about the need for data normalization, the risk involved in augmenting the loss function with a fairness-regularizer, algorithm aversion, what incentives could companies have to introduce more fairness, the need for regulation and more.
