If we're speaking very long term, why not imagine that big data and machine learning will even replace the UI designer, with not one UI for an app or website, but contents presented in a dashboard tailored to the user's personal preferences to be the most effective? 
Not only such an interface would adapt to the device (which is already the case), but even to the mood and intellectual capability of a specific user depending on the time of day, day of week and locations? I'm personally not keen on such an individualized experience, but this might come to be, when you know about Anticipatory Design.
