### Why User Research?

I had already participated in projects focusing on User Experience, and a good way of describing teaching would be a Learning Experience Designer. 

In January 2015, I decided to re-orient my career path towards **UX**. 

I studied and passed my **Anthropology degree** at University of Strasbourg in France in June 2016. I spent heaps of time learning and practicing UX techniques through the **Interaction Design Specialization** on Coursera. I also dived in the **UX community** news and feeds, where I learned a lot from articles and posts. I took on projects on a **volunteer** basis (Doris Women Refuge, Ballard.dog).

I'm curious about everything, basically, but I'm passionate about people. 
I believe in a holistic approach combining all perspectives: HCI, psychology, sociology, anthropology and all methods: from big data to ethnographic study.

### Before that, I spent...

#### 10 years in Education

Pedagogy is to teaching what UX is to design: people are at the center of every project.

#### 5 years of Project Management

Nothing does the job better than teamwork and relationships based on mutual trust.
