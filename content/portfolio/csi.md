## Earlier projects at Cite des sciences et de l'industrie

Working as a project manager at Cite des sciences et de l'industrie, Science Museum in Paris, my first objective was to improve the experience of visitors, especially of teachers visiting with their class. 

### Facilitate the use of online resources for teachers

I was in charge of the Education website. The first project was mostly directed to respond to internal needs, such as empowering staff working in educational program to update themselves the information regarding their program. This also contributed to improve the experience of the users, as they had access to accurate and up-to-date information. The overhaul of the website was also the opportunity to redesign the structure and navigation, so it was user-oriented, rather than business oriented. The older version orgqnization reflected the different departments, and a primary teacher had to visit several parts to find all the relevant information for their students. The new organization reflected the different objectives of the teachers, as well as the levels they're teaching at (distinction between primary and secondary education, between visit and online resources).

During this first phase, I identified others needs and problems teachers had when using the general website of the museum, which was a collection of different smaller websites, with no common navigation or organization. While the project to overhaul the entire website was led by another team, I worked with them to try and improve the outcomes for teachers.

#### Teachers' goals 

- find relevant resources for their classes,
- give an easy access to these selected resources to their students
- organize online activities based on these resources

#### Pain points

- Resources are extensive, but difficult to find, because they are divided in a number of different sub-sites
- Even though there is a general search engine, covering all the subsites, resources weren't always tagged according to the specific level teachers need.
Example: when looking for resources in physics on a specific topic, the relevant resources found by the search engine could cover levels starting for 8 year old students to lectures given by university professors. 
- to use a set of different resources from different part of the website, no easy navigation were possible. Teachers had to use a series of links (themselves being very long URLs).
- all activities based on these resources had to be organized by the teachers themselves on an external platform, their school website, their own or just word documents with hyperlinks shared with the students.

#### Context

Virtual Learning Environment were just starting to develop in France at the time, and most schools did not have them yet. Guidelines and specifications had already been developed by the French Ministry of Education for VLE (named Espace numerique de Travail or digital work space). Those guidelines included the possibility of third-party applications, that could operate within or next to the VLE. This option seemed to be an excellent opportunity of development for the resource rich website of the Cite des Sciences et de l'Industrie, if we could offer an interface for teachers and students to access and share resources and to organize online activities. 

#### The project itself

The project was to provide a virtual learning environment dedicated to science, giving an easy access to all the resources of the CSI website, allowing teachers to share them easily with their classes, to organize online activities based on those resources and share them with other teachers. 

The implementation took the form of a webOS (eyeOS) where teachers could easily create accounts for each student in their class, search for resources and create learning activities that they could then share with the students. 

However, the integration with ENT was not possible to implement at first, limiting the audience to the teachers visiting the website. I had initiated a number of contacts with ENT providers and education organizations to try and establish partnership including SSO and sharing of resources, but this was not followed through after I left.

The easy access and use of all the resources on the website depended in part of the implementation of another large project, the overhaul of the entire website, under the responsibility of another team. 
At the time of my departure from Cite des Sciences et de l'industrie, this project wasn't achieved yet.

### Improving the visit experience

Another frequent pain point for teachers (or families) visiting the exhibitions is the impossibility to see everything in the limited time they have (generally half a day, on average two hours and a half). 

#### Conflict between expectations and actual experience
The tickets they book state that it gives access to all exhibitions. Therefore, they expect to see them all, and make the most of the price they paid for their tickets. 
After having visiting a first exhibition, they quickly realize that they don't have much time left. And rush to see most of the others. This doesn't result in a satisfying experience. Visitors don't really take the time to enjoy the exhibits, they grow tired and frustrated, and have the impression that they have wasted their money, because they couldn't see them all. 

The experience is far different in another, even larger, museum like the Louvre Museum. Visitors don't expect to see everything, so they pick and choose one or two areas, they enjoy their visit and are usually very satisfied with their experience. 

So the key was to reshape the expectations and knowledge of the visitors regarding what was available and doable in the amount of time they have. We were looking in particular at how to help teachers plan their visit with their class. 

#### Helping teachers plan a visit with their class

The program offered at cite des sciences et de l'industrie is very complex, as it includes three different spaces of exhibitions, three cinema theatres, a planetarium, workshops and demonstrations as well as lectures. Some activities have a specific start time, some don't, some have a specific duration, others don't, some require booking, some don't. Basically, all the combinations of these three components were possible. It was therefore very complex for visitors to understand what they could do and when. 

The project was to propose a tool to plan the visit, where teachers could select activities he was interested in, and start building a visit schedule by simply drag and dropping them. All the information  necessary was already available through a large database, but the booking system didn't take into account schedule elements, nor the time necessary to visit one specific exhibition. 

I wrote the specifications on this project, but didn't supervise the implementation which was done after my departure through a contractor.
