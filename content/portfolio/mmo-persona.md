As a research project for my Anthropology degree, I studied a Massive Multiplayer Online Game *The Lord of the Rings Online*. I used two methodologies: participant observation and interviews. I wrote my thesis on MMO and social representations, nased on this research as well as academic and industry studies.

This research includes many useful insights in players' motivations, goals and pain points, but an 88-page thesis wasn't the best format to communicate them. 

So I chose to create six personas to illustrate my findings in a synthetic and concrete way. Each persona is composite, the sum of multiple inputs. Each of them concentrates in one archetype several typical attributes I found in different players.

### In brief

- xxx hours of participant observation
- 15 hours of interviews
- xxx pages read.
- xx pages written.
- 6 personas

### Persona sample
